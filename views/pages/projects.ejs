          <p>
            AmazeJobs keeps track of users' job applications: their progress, deadlines, and tasks associated with each application. It strives to alleviate the users' burden of remembering all the jobs they applied to, which of them responded, and tasks with deadlines that must not be forgotten.

        <h3>What Song Is It Anyway?</h3>
        <p>
          This Android app plays snippets of songs from the user's music library on their phone and challenges the user to correctly guess as many song titles as possible in a certain amount of time. Adjustable settings make it easy for users to go at their own pace. Fuzzy matching aids with garbled song titles.

          In a team of four, we started out creating this project for our Android class (21w.789), but went on to continue development and start public releases after the class ended. Made with Java and MySQL.
